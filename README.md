# Matlab code to select ground motions with the generalized conditional intensity measure approach for eastern Canada

This software can be used to select ground motions for eastern Canada with the generalized conditional intensity measure approach,
considering a set of seismic IMs that includes horizontal and vertical spectral acceleration at different periods and PGV.

This tool was developped in collaboration with the research group at School of Advanced Studies IUSS Pavia (Italy), under the supervision 
of Prof. Ricardo Monteiro.

Canada.” Earthquake Spectra (under-review).
